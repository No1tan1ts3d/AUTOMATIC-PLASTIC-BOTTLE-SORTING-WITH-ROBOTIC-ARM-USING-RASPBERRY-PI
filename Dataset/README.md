## The dataset includes 1409 images was colleted from dumping ground of Bhaktapur Muncipality, roads and web scrapping.
### Plastic-bottle-3sBm are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

## The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Stretch)

## The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.38 percent of pixels

## Now there are 3383 images after augmentaion.
